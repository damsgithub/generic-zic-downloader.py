# generic-zic-downloader.py


Supports myzuka.club and musify.club, maybe more later

Command line downloader with optionnal rich interface (think ncurses), features included:
* Cover downloading
* Windows (powershell or cmd prompt) and Linux support (even WSL)
* Resume incomplete songs and albums downloads (see BUGS)
* Creation of directory with "Artist - Album (year)" name (see BUGS).
* Multiple simultaneous downloads to download faster
* Able to download all albums from an artist
* Socks proxy support
* Colored output
* progress bars with [rich](https://github.com/willmcgugan/rich) (optionnal, see "live" argument)

Inspired by [xor512 script](https://github.com/xor512/musicmp3spb.org)

TODO:
* streaming mode?

BUGS:
* it is more difficult to interrupt the script with ctrl-c in Windows with latests Python version, even with [this bug](https://bugs.python.org/issue42296) corrected.
* Only with musify.club: if you interrupt the script and then relaunch it, it will sometimes append to the mp3 file from the beginning of the song instead of resuming the download... prefer myzuka.club until it is corrected. Although you will have this kind of message "{file_name} is already bigger ({dlded_size}) than the server side file ({real_size}). Either server side file size could not be determined or an other problem occured, check file manually" if you happen to relaunch the script a third time once everything is finished. So you will know if it happened and you will be able to delete these files and relaunch the script a fourth time to have them non corrupted...
* It does not support multiple artists when creating the directory, it will fall back to "Unknown", you will have to rename the dir by hand afterwards.
* Some regexes (ie: the one to detect deleted tracks from website on myzuka) might be a little bit CPU intensives and are slowing down the script a bit compared to previous versions.

Install:
* install python 3 (tested with 3.6, 3.9, 3.12) if not already present on your distrib. For Windows, see [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/) or install from the Windows Store.
* install required modules. Use your standard repo or the command line below for linux, for Windows do it in an administrator powershell command prompt:

```sh
python -m pip install BeautifulSoup4 Pysocks rich
```

Notes: 
* you need rich >= 10.0.0

Usage:
* Just give it an album or artist url from myzuka.club or musify.club as argument, see below:

```
